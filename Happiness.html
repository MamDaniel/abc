- James H. Aughey
<br>

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">

- Charles Spurgeon

-C.S. Lewis
<br>
</div>


<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">
<br>"Christ's life unfolds, in part, as we learn to appreciate the gifts He has given us. How easy it is to blame others for our unhappiness, but we are only unhappy when something other than Christ has become our life. (For example) The husband or wife who has Christ as their life, comes to their spousal relationship already satisfied. They do not come continually looking to made happy by another person's attention; they bring Christ's life to their spouse."
- Francis Frangipane

<br>"Affection is responsible for nine-tenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our 
lives."
-C.S. Lewis
<br>
</div>

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green  w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">
<br>"When anything in life is an absolute requirement for your happiness and self-worth, it is essentially 
an 'idol,' something you are actually worshiping. When such a thing is threatened, your anger is absolute.
 Your anger is actually the way the idol keeps you in its service, in its chains. Therefore if you find that,
 despite all the efforts to forgive, your anger and bitterness cannot subside, you may need to look deeper and ask,
 'What am I defending? What is so important that I cannot live without?' It may be that, until some inordinate 
desire is identified and confronted, you will not be able to master your anger."
- Tim Keller
