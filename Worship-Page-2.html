<br>"God must speak to us before we have any liberty to speak to him. He must disclose to us who he is before we can offer him what we are in acceptable worship. The worship of God is always a response to the Word of God. Scripture wonderfully directs and enriches our worship."
- John Stott

<br>"For all of us involved in preaching the gospel, performing music, publishing Christian materials, and all the rest, there is an uncomfortable message here: Jesus is not terribly impressed with religious commercialism"

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">
<br>"Worship is our innermost being responding with praise for all that God is, through our attitudes, actions, thoughts, and words, based on the truth of God as He has revealed Himself."
- John MacArthur

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green  w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">

"Without the heart it is not worship; it is a stage play; an acting a part without being that person really a hypocrite. We may truly be said to worship God-though we lack perfection; but we cannot be said to worship Him if we lack sincerity."
- Stephen Charnock

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">
<br>"We're here to be worshippers first and workers only second. We take a convert and immediately make a worker out of him. God never meant it to be so. God meant that a convert should learn to be a worshiper, and after that he can learn to be a worker...The work done by a worshiper will have eternity in it."
- A. W. Tozer

<br>"A little lifting of the heart suffices; a little remembrance of God, one act of inward worship are prayers which, however short, are nevertheless acceptable to God."
- Brother Lawrence

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green  w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">
<br>"The best worship that we ever render to God is far from perfect. Our praises, how faint and feeble they are! Our prayers, how wandering, how wavering they are! When we get nearest to God, how far off we are! When we are most like Him, how greatly unlike Him we are!"
- Charles Spurgeon

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green  w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">

<br>"Above all sing spiritually. Have an eye to God in every word you sing. Aim at pleasing him more than yourself, or any other creature. In order to do this attend strictly to the sense of what you sing, and see that your heart is not carried away with the sound, but offered to God continually; so shall your singing be such as the Lord will approve here, and reward you when he cometh in the clouds of heaven."
- John Wesley

<br>"Should I worship Him from fear of hell, may I be cast into it. Should I serve Him from desire of gaining heaven, may He keep me out. But should I worship Him from love alone, He reveals Himself to me, that my whole heart may be filled with His love and presence."
