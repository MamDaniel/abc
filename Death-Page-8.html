<br>""Perfect correspondence," according to Mr. Herbert Spencer, would be "perfect Life." To abolish Death,
 therefore, all that would be necessary would be to abolish Imperfection. But it is the claim of Christianity 
 that it can abolish Death. And it is significant to notice that it does so by meeting this very demand of Science--it abolishes Imperfection."
<br>- Henry Drummond

<br>"Some day you will read in the papers that D.L. Moody of East Northfield, is dead. Don't you believe a word of it! At that moment I shall be more alive than I am now; I shall have gone up higher, that is all, out of this old clay tenement into a house that is immortal- a body that death cannot touch, that sin cannot taint; a body fashioned like unto His glorious body."

<br>"There is an essential difference between the decease of the godly and the death of the ungodly. Death comes to the ungodly man as a penal infliction, but to the righteous as a summons to his Father's palace. To the sinner it is an execution, to the saint an undressing from his sins and infirmities. Death to the wicked is the King of terrors. Death to the saint is the end of terrors, the commencement of glory."
<br>- Charles Spurgeon
