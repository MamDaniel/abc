- Jerry Bridges

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green  w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">
<br>"Worship is a believer's response to God's revelation of Himself. It is expressing wonder, awe, and gratitude for the worthiness, the greatness, and the goodness of our Lord. It is the appropriate response to God's person, His provision, His power, His promises, and His plan."
- Nancy Leigh DeMoss

</div>

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green  w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">
<br>"There is, however, equally great incentive to worship and love God in the thought that, for some unfathomable reason, He wants me as His friend, and desires to be my friend, and has given His Son to die for me in order to realize this purpose. not merely that we know God, but that He knows us."
- J.I. Packer

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green  w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">
<br>
"Word and worship belong indissolubly to each other. All worship is an intelligent and loving response to the revelation of God, because it is the adoration of His name. Therefore, acceptable worship is impossible without preaching. For preaching is making known the name of the Lord, and worship is praising the name of the Lord made known."
- John Stott

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green  w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">
<br>"Begin to rejoice in the Lord, and your bones will flourish like an herb, and your cheeks will glow with the bloom of health and freshness. Worry, fear, distrust, care-all are poisonous! Joy is balm and healing, and if you will but rejoice, God will give power."
- A. B. Simpson

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green  w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">
<br>"When it comes to satisfying our spiritual appetites, there is no such thing as excess. There are no restraints placed on us by God. There are no rules of temperance or laws requiring moderation or boundaries beyond which we cannot go in seeking to enjoy Him. We need never pause to inquire whether we've crossed a line or become overindulgent. You need never fear feeling too good about God."
- Sam Storms

- Jonathan Edwards
<br>
</div>

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green  w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">
<br>"I wonder if there was ever a time when true spiritual worship was at a lower ebb. To great sections of the church, the art of worship has been lost entirely, and in its place has come that strange and foreign thing called the "program." This word has been borrowed from the stage and applied with sad wisdom to the public service which now passes for worship among us."
- A. W. Tozer

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green  w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">
<br>
"The foundation of true holiness and true Christian worship is the doctrine of the gospel, what we are to believe. So when Christian doctrine is neglected, forsaken, or corrupted, true holiness and worship will also be neglected, forsaken, and corrupted."
- John Owen

<div class="w3-container w3-card w3-shadow w3-center w3-green  w3-panel w3-round w3-animate-zoom">
<br>
"Regardless of the reaction of others, one thing is certain: True worship and devotion will make our lives fragrant and will perfume the environment around us. Our homes, our churches, even our places of work will bear the sweet scent of our devotion. Most important, the Lord Jesus will be pleased. And ultimately that is all that really matters."
